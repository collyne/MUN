        <h2 class="blink">What is MUN ?</h2>
        <p> Model United Nations (MUN) is a club organised by students for students. It is like a big roleplay where every student becomes a diplomat, represents a country and debates about a determined topic,based on real-world issues.</p>

        <h2>How does a typical session looks like ?</h2>
        <p>We usually start by taking the placard of the country we represent. Then, each delegate has the possiblity to present a clause on which other delegates have to suggest amendements. Then we vote and try to ameliorate the clause. As delegates, you can also present the position of your country on the ongoing topic.</p>

        <h2>Different roles in MUN :</h2>
        <p>In a typical MUN session, you have of course all the delegates, which are here to represent a country and its gouvernement interests. There is also the chairs, two students who are here to organize the debate. They are like to keep the debate calm, like game masters.</p>
        <h2>MUN officers :</h2>
        <p>They are absolutely essentials to MUN. Our MUN officers (democratically elected) are always here to send the mails, find interessant topics and make country lists.</p>
