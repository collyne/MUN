        <h3>Can you introduce yourself ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hi! I'm Mark Labous, 15 years old and one of the officers of the Model United Nations club of my high school (LFA Buc). I really love to debate and to be involved in the processes that I participate in. Outside of school, I run track as a sprinter and also coach the little kids in my club. </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>What do you like most about MUN?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I really love that in MUN, you never get to have the same opinion. The debate is very dependent on which topic is chosen and which country you are assigned -- it's impossible to react the same way on different occasions. On top of this is the fact that you can assume outrageous opinions (within reason), which is something that sometimes feels refreshing and removes the gravity of some topics. </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Why did you want to become an officer ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I always loved to debate, to participate in class decisions and to stand up for my opinions and the ways that I imagined projects. By being a MUN officer, I get to do all of the above on top of choosing the different topics debated (which is definitely a plus)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>What do you actually do as an officer ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As an officer, my work is mostly made up of sending emails and working on google docs for organization of the weekly club. But I also get to have an influence in special projects such as VEMUN amongst others. I try to be attentive to the demands of my fellow club members and always make myself open to discussion with our other two officers and with the rest of the club. We also try to pay as close attention as we can to other conferences happening around us.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Can you tell us about the projects you helped organize this year ?
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This year I had the amazing opportunity to help with the organization of our biggest event, VEMUN. VEMUN is a three day multi-school international MUN conference that we entertained here at the LFA for the second time. With the help of our MUN director Mrs. Rostaing, we managed several committees focused on financing, press, the writing of research reports and so much more. Besides VEMUN, which thankfully was a unanimous success, we also helped to coordinate a large debate with the visit of students from the Netherlands on the theme of rising sea levels.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>How would you explain MUN to someone who has no idea what it is ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>MUN, generally, is an internationally recognized club in which participants get to present, debate and vote on legislation in accordance with the actual processes of the UN. The club is fully run in English, by students and for the students. In addition to this, it's possible to attend conferences where fellow MUN-ers will debate with you in different committees (a really great experience!)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Why did you join MUN ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I joined MUN because I always loved to debate. Orderly debate fashion passioned before entering high school and I knew that I was either going to join a debate or a MUN club. A MUN club it was!</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>A quote or word that represents you ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Any tips for new members ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When I started off in MUN I was very stressed at first. It felt like I had a whole world of specific vocabulary, of rules and of people to convince. My biggest point of advice is to just get out there and try. Don't waste any time worrying and just think about your first clause, speech or anything. You can start small, or big, whatever! There are no rules and the easiest is really only to get started.</li>
