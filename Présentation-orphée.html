        <h3>Can you introduce yourself ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OrphÃ©e (1sia2), Iâ€™m 16 and iâ€™ve been in the Mun club for 2 years, officer for one year</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>What do you like most about MUN?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The people of the club are all nice so itâ€™s a good atmosphere to debate in and have fun :)
                Ps the photo i added was of the opening ceremony of VEMUN (mun conference hosted by the LFA and Grandchamp)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Why did you want to become an officer ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I love the logistics behind mun more than i love the debate, so i decided to run for officer and be able to organize all of this for everyone</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>What do you actually do as an officer ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We chose the subjects we debate, make the country lists for each debate, organize events such as VEMUN or smaller debates (ex: we invited a dutch school to the lfa for an afternoon for a mun debate)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Can you tell us about the projects you helped organize this year ?
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For VEMUN we sent invites to other schools (french and european in general), found sponsors, guest speakers, organized the rooms for the event, we also organized the students (press team, those debatingâ€¦), that was the main project of the year and with its great success, weâ€™ll be holding a VEMUN 2025 next year, which iâ€™ll also have the pleasure of organizing. Our other projects are on a much smaller scale (Dutch debate, organizing MUN games the first day of the rentrÃ©eâ€¦)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>How would you explain MUN to someone who has no idea what it is ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>MUN is a debate club were we debate as countries (taking on their point of vies) on topics discussed in the actual United Nations committees</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Why did you join MUN ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I joined because I had always wanted to try a debate club</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>A quote or word that represents you ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I think organized would be a good word to describe me, at least thatâ€™s what those of the mun club would say </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Any tips for new members ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dont be afraid to participate! It can seem a little intimidating at first, especially if english isnâ€™t your first language, or you dont understand the debate procedure. Never hesitate to ask questions and speak up, the people of the MUN club are all very kind and Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d help anyone anyway they could :)</li>
